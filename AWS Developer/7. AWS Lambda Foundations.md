# AWS Lambda
- Is a compute service
- Can **run code** without provisioning or maintaining servers
- **Initiates functions** in response to events
- **Scales** automatically
- Provides built-in code **monitoring & logging** via Amazon CloudWatch

## AWS Lambda features
- #### Bring own code
	- Write code using languages already know
	- Port code I/O of AWS
- #### Integrates with & extends other AWS services
	- Calling AWS SDK, invoking APIs
	- Whether on AWS, in a datacenter or on the internet
- #### Flexible resource and concurrency
	- Scales in response to events
	- Only configure memory settings
	- AWS handles details such as CPU, network, I/O
- #### Flexible permissions model
	- Uses AWS Identity & Access Management (IAM) to securely grant access to resources
	- Provide fine-grained control to invoke functions
- #### Availability and fault tolerance are built in
	- Lambda is a fully managed service
	- HIgh availability & fault tolerance are built into the service
- #### Pay for value
	- Lambda functions only run when initiated
	- Pay only for the compute time that being consumed
	- When code is invoked, billed in 1ms increments
