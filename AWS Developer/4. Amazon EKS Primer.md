## Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)
Is a managed container orchestration service that facilitates deploying, managing, and scaling Kubernetes applications in the AWS Cloud or on premises.

Helps to provide highly available and secure clusters. 

Also helps you automate key tasks such as patching, node provisioning, and updates.

### The need for container orchestration
Containers provide a standard way to package your application's code, configurations, and dependencies into a single object.

They are lightweight and provide a consistent, portable software environment for applications to run and scale anywhere.
Applications running in containers require a container orchestration platform to manage and scale deployments.

Different management platforms might manage different aspects of the container system.

# Kubernetes
## Cluster
A set of worker machines, called nodes, that run containerized applications.
- Every cluster has at least one worker node. 
- A cluster also has a control plane that runs services that manage the cluster.

## Node
A virtual or physical machine, which runs the workload by grouping containers into pods and assigning those pods to run on nodes.
Each node is managed by the control plane and contains the services necessary to run pods.

## Pod
A group of one or more containers.
- Are defined by a PodSpec file, a specification for how to run the containers.
- Pods are the basic building block within Kubernetes for deployment, scaling, and replication.

## Ephemeral volume
Applications in a pod have access to shared volumes to facilitate data sharing in the pod and persistence of data across container restarts.
- When a pod ceases to exist, Kubernetes destroys ephemeral volumes.
## Persistent volume
Similar to an ephemeral volume but has a lifecycle independent of any individual pod that uses them.
Persistent volumes are backed by storage subsystems independent of cluster nodes.

## Service
A logical collection of pods and a means to access them.
The service is continually updated with the set of pods available, eliminating the need for pods to track other pods.

## Namespace
A virtual cluster that is backed by the same physical cluster.
- Physical clusters can have resources with the same name as long as they are in different namespaces.
- Namespaces are especially useful when you have multiple teams or projects using the same cluster.

## ReplicaSet
Ensures that a specific number of pod replicas are running at any given time.

## Deployment
Owns and manages ReplicaSets or individual pods.
- Describes a desired state in the deployment.
- The deployment then changes the actual state of the cluster to the desired state at a controlled rate.

## ConfigMap
Is an API object that stores nonconfidential data as key-value pairs used by other Kubernetes objects, such as pods.
- Use ConfigMaps to follow the best practice of portability by separating your configuration data from your application code.
## Secrets
All confidential data, such as AWS credentials.
Secrets restrict access to sensitive information. 
- Optionally, encryption can be turned on to improve security.
