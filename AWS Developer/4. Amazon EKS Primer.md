## Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)
Is a managed container orchestration service that facilitates deploying, managing, and scaling Kubernetes applications in the AWS Cloud or on premises.

Helps to provide highly available and secure clusters. 

Also helps you automate key tasks such as patching, node provisioning, and updates.

### The need for container orchestration
Containers provide a standard way to package your application's code, configurations, and dependencies into a single object.

They are lightweight and provide a consistent, portable software environment for applications to run and scale anywhere.
Applications running in containers require a container orchestration platform to manage and scale deployments.

Different management platforms might manage different aspects of the container system.

# Kubernetes
## Cluster
A set of worker machines, called nodes, that run containerized applications.
- Every cluster has at least one worker node. 
- A cluster also has a control plane that runs services that manage the cluster.
